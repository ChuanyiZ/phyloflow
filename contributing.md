#Guideline for contributing to this repository

## Overview
- We will track phyloflow and FAVE-phylo bugs in this repo's *issues*.
- Large improvements should get an issue as well, so we can discuss before real coding happens.
- Submit Pull Requests with any improvements. They are most welcome. 
- Please write detailed descriptions in PRs. We are more likely to track PRs than issues or commit 
messages in the long term (eg when making changelogs for releases).
